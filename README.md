# Chow Bot üç≥
## Welcome to Chow Bot!
Chow Bot is a web application that allows users to query recipe suggestions based on ingredients, meal type
(breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.), and course type (entree, side, dessert, etc.). Using a chat client built
in React, users submit messages that are processed by a Dialogflow agent on a Node backend. The Dialogflow
agent extracts the intent of the user's message and any necessary parameters and returns those to Chow Bot's
Node backend to form a response for the user.
